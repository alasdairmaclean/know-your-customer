# Assumptions/notes

* "ObjectId" is generated by this service (rather than being passed in when created)
* Indexes have been added to search columns, but zero performance testing/tuning has been done
* App is small and so self-contained integration tests (ApplicationIntTest.java) provide good enough coverage - as the application
gets larger component/unit tests will be required (e.g. repository tests, controller tests)
* Similarly, there's little logic in the controllers currently - if/when more complexity is added it may be worth creating a
separate set of service classes. 
* An in memory database (H2) is used for the purposes of the exercise.

# TODOs

* Add indexes for search (all fields are potentially searchable)
